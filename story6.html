<p>While growing up in Kenya, I never thought of myself as African. Perhaps it rested at the back of my mind, because I knew I lived in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya – a country in the Eastern region of the African continent. I never thought of myself as Kenyan, because I did not recognize a tangible Kenyan culture, and what I was later told to be “Kenyan” appeared to me as the norm. We cooked <i>pilau</i> for special occasions; we made fun of stereotypes because we liked to laugh. Some of us gave <i>kitu kidogo </i>(bribes), and many of us complained about greedy politicians. My normal life never constituted a culture, because it was what we always did, it was our norm.</p>
<p>I became Kenyan when I met Tanzanians and Ugandans, when it became necessary to imagine my existence around theirs. I became Kenyan when no one knew where my rural home was, when it was easier to say I came from the capital. I became Kenyan when I screamed for joy with other Kenyans, because we had the best marathon runners in the world. “That should make you proud to be Kenyan,” I was told. There and then, I learnt to be Kenyan.</p>
<p>The Kenyan me became African in America. I became African when my hosts’ cries about homesickness seemed trivial for one who had travelled thousands of miles to get education. I became African when I went for conferences, when we were charged to go “back home”, to stop being part of the “brain drain”, to be part of the “new generation” that would make Africa the next stop for investors. I became African when the disgustingly usual happened, when Africa equaled to disease and corruption and war and hunger.</p>
<p>And eventually, I began hating this “African”, because it meant condensing all Africa into one, and my Kenyan identity was never acknowledged. <i>Ignorance would think that Africa is a country with Mandela as president</i>. I hated it more when I was only known as the Kenyan woman on campus, because that was all they would ever see me as: the dark-skinned lady from the poster-child country of development agents and scholars. I hated that being African was a burden to carry, a sticky label that read: “You were colonized. You are not good enough. Let me help you, sister.” I hated that other Africans expected me to revolutionize, to liberate my mind and go back to the traditions of our ancestors, “the way things used to be”. I did not understand the fascination with dropping all Western names. <i>I like my name just as it is, because it reflects the complexity of my world</i>. Some embrace being African, because reclaiming a burdened identity expels its power over you, making you the agent of your own fate. Some reject being African, and seek the aboriginal, the identity untainted by past and present colonizing processes. And still, some ignore being African, and never discover that being so comes with a price. Yet for all of us, the burden of being African affects our history, and will affect the future of those who come after us.</p>
<p>But the tragedy isn’t in the burdened identity that makes many think of us only as African or Kenyan or Nigerian or (insert ethnic group). Neither does it lie in the failed attempts we make when we challenge the status quo, nor when we question why we are monolithic figurines of the Western world. The real tragedy lies in failing to find a way to live with the label, in failing to reconcile our passions and our anger. More importantly, it lies in failing to know that we can be more than our assigned labels. We belong to an infinite cosmos. We can be more than ‘African’. We can make the fleeting moments count, choosing to be whatever we wish to in the midst of myriad voices telling us what identity to embody. And when we learn how to live beyond fractured identities, we will know a full life; the kind that surges forth, unhurt and uncompromised by anyone, the kind that’s more than just being African</p>
