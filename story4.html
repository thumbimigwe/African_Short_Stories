<p>I play football everyday after work except Friday. You see, I had started developing a tummy. In Luo we say, <em> stomach was coming.</em> I am skinny. Skinny and a coming stomach do not really go wsell together seeing as all my clothes fit really close to the skin.<br>
I am not great at football but I enjoy it a lot. I have just learned how to stop the ball with my chest. This is utterly painful and I do not understand why people do it. It’s that or I am doing it wrong. I cough every time I stop the ball with my small chest.</p>

<p>Today after football I decided to go to my bank in Yaya Centre. I got into my car and was too tired to change into my normal clothes so I decided I’d go in my training gear.<br>
I got to the Yaya basement parking and walked towards the entrance with utmost confidence. My cleats clicked as I walked on the concrete. My socks were knee-high with my shorts mid-thigh. I felt like Pele walking into a stadium.<br>
People looked at me a bit funny as I walked past them but I assumed it was because of the clicking sound my cleats made as I walked. An elderly woman who was walking towards me, saw me and covered her eyes with her hands… Like a child would when they see grown ups kissing. I paid zero attention. I was cool and that was that.<br></p>
<p>I go to the entrance and the guard who was standing behind the metal detector asked me if I was sure I wanted to go in ‘like that.’
<p><em>“Utaingia hivyo?”</em> He asked. I was a bit offended by his question and I shot back at him rudely.</p>
        <p><em>“Kwani!”</em> I said.</p>
<p><em>“Lakini kitu yako kinaonekana!”</em> He said pointing at my shorts.</p>
<p>I looked down at my shorts and as true as death, my penis was hanging out of my shorts through a huge slit. I had not noticed that I had ripped my pants.<br>
I grabbed my ‘belongings’ and ran back to the car. My cleats clicked louder as I ran. The shock on people’s faces as I ran past them made so much sense now.<br>
The elderly woman saw me running towards her and ran to her car, got in and locked the doors. It did not help that I was parked right next to her.<br>
Poor woman.
