Hanging A Bit Too Low

I play football everyday after work except Friday. I started this not too far back. You see, I had started developing a tummy. In Luo we say, my stomach was coming. I am skinny. Skinny and a coming stomach do not really go well together seeing as all my clothes fit really close to the skin.
I am not great at football but I enjoy it a lot. I have just learned how to stop the ball with my chest. This is utterly painful and I do not understand why people do it. It’s that or I am doing it wrong. I cough every time I stop the ball with my small chest.
Today after football I decided to go to my bank in Yaya Centre. I got into my car and was too tired to change into my normal clothes so I decided I’d go in my training gear.
I got to the Yaya basement parking and walked towards the entrance with utmost confidence. My cleats clicked as I walked on the concrete. My socks were knee-high with my shorts mid-thigh. I felt like Pele walking into a stadium.
People looked at me a bit funny as I walked past them but I assumed it was because of the clicking sound my cleats made as I walked. An elderly woman who was walking towards me, saw me and covered her eyes with her hands… Like a child would when they see grown ups kissing. I paid zero attention. I was cool and that was that.
I go to the entrance and the guard who was standing behind the metal detector asked me if I was sure I wanted to go in ‘like that.’
“Utaingia hivyo?” He asked. I was a bit offended by his question and I shot back at him rudely.
” Kwani!” I said.
“Lakini kitu yako kinaonekana!” He said pointing at my shorts.
I looked down at my shorts and as true as death, my penis was hanging out of my shorts through a huge slit. I had not noticed that I had ripped my pants.
I grabbed my ‘belongings’ and ran back to the car. My cleats clicked louder as I ran. The shock on people’s faces as I ran past them made so much sense now.
The elderly woman saw me running towards her and ran to her car, got in and locked the doors. It did not help that I was parked right next to her.
Poor woman.
