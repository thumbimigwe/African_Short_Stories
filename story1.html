    <p>Kenya is our land and with everything that has been happening, God knows we need some comic relief.
Being a Kenyan is a full time job, from dealing with WWE Members of parliament , to bookmarking every ‘how to act in a hostage situation’ article there is out there, The struggle is real. Let’s see all what we have to deal with at every stage of our Kenyan lives!</p>

<p><strong>0-5 years</strong><br>
Who run the world?  It must be the first lady of Kenya,  Maggie. Every time I see that woman,she is running. Lol. It’s for a good cause though,  I just found out that the infant mortality rate in Kenya right now is 77.. That means out of every 1000 births in Kenya, 77 don’t live to turn 5! I mean this is the real terrorist. There are so many things that cause this..  Malaria,  diarrhea..  Even the house helps we employ in our homes are hazardous.. The fact that we survive at all is a miracle. In some places,  the maternity hospitals are so far that by the time your husband gets you there, you two are expecting your next kid. When you survive to live beyond zero (see what I did there?) your parents will probably take you to preschool, if they can afford it ,or to the streets to sell ground nuts on Friday Nights at Archives to drunk pedophiles. They hurried you to learn how to walk and talk so you can inherit the family Empire of begging, stealing and running away from the City Council. The lucky ones are taken to Kindergarten, the rest of us are taken to a nursery school near our estate where the only qualification the teacher has , is that her blood is red. Like when I was a kid, I went to a nursery school in Eastlands. My recess friends would be picked up in a van adorned with Disney characters and fun creative things.. While me and my PE mob walked to school. By the time you get to school,you are so tired and dusty but you have to learn that ABC song, again..  That you have been taught for two years but what else will the teacher teach you?  That’s as far as her accent can go. By the time I settled in, my dear friends in the Kiandas and Riaras were being taught how to pronounce ‘ wora ‘ (water) , C for Cet and how to play the Violin for the next talent show. The only talent show public schools have is on Friday afternoons when the girls have to wash the class rooms and the boys fetch water..  And they wonder why girls grow up to bend over like that. Lol. Afternoons are meant for sleep (siesta for recess kids) but you all wake up soaked in pee that you aren’t even sure is yours. One for the team. Maybe that’s why people grow to become Urophiliacs. (I just high 5d myself for that big word)<br></p>

<p><strong>5 – 18 Years.</strong><br>
This is the easiest stage to survive in Kenya. Once you learn to eat solid food, your parents initiate you into this national cult called Ugali and Sukuma. It doesn’t even matter if you live in Kibera slums or the green leafy suburbs of Loresho..   Ugali is ugali. You cannot add spices and even if you boil it with the water your uncle brought from Britain,it still tastes the same. Why isn’t it on our flag again?  Haha, any way.. Those of us whose fathers grab land from primary schools go to international school , the middle class go to Academies that have the oddest names,like ‘ Morning Glory Academy ‘ and the rest carry their face masks and go to public schools. Going to international schools means, your teachers accept you the way you are, you talent isn’t in class? Fine. Take a football,go get yourself a concussion . Or here is a harp, be David, go stone. (see what I did there?  Haha)  Or join the Christmas musical ,after a few plastic surgeries you might become famous. These schools encourage kids in all fields. Their teachers have Capiroo FM accents and they interact with kids from all over the world. Next best thing , your parents afford a decent Academy maybe even boarding. Or a good public high school. In these schools, academics come first and they spoon feed knowledge into your head like the doctor prescribed it. In highschool, you have to sleep with a packed bag and shoes in a strategic position in case someone decides to burn down your dormitory because a mosquito bit him. If you survive the night, you wake up for an early morning prep yet you spend 30 minutes arranging your desk, 30minutes making a personal time table, 30 minutes writing a letter to your boo in another school, then you tell your desk mate to wake you up after a 15minutes ‘power nap’. finally, the other 15 minutes are taken to look for your spoon in preparation for the dining hall , only to compensate for the sleep you missed on a hot afternoon Kiswahili lesson after a big plate of githeri. The lessons are a big blur of Probability this,  molarity that, stylistic devices this and dormant volcanoes that. Just a lot of unmotivated teachers going on and on about things they barely understand just so I rewrite it upon request. Can you tell me the industrial preparation of vodka or nah?<br>
The other class of people go to public primary schools and estate secondary schools because the fee is manageable and education is the Kenyan idol. Forget the quality. The only international thing about these schools,  is the Japanese car that the headmaster drives. Every teacher has little to no knowledge of the subjects. He even writes in an accent. The class rooms are so over populated and under equipped that you could get an STD, and the teachers should be charged with attempted murder for how they whip the kids. As if that’s not enough, you might go to school and be tear gased! Sad but those are the facts.<br>
This no ranking non sense is the reason why I see so many 16 year olds in clubs in Westlands. Do this, the next time you see a kid in club dancing to Burna boy, give him/her a chemical equation, let them check and balance THAT.<br></p>

<p><strong>19 – 30 Years</strong><br>
“University is a fountain, where everyone comes to drink. ” Rave.. Dunda… Clubbing..  Kayumbet..  Whatever you call it, it is perfected in this age bracket. You walk in Westlands at night, girls with 3 inch skirts , 6 inch heels and 12 inch weaves every where! They trade in their pencils for eyeliner and their uniform for see-through or glow in the dark everything. Drinking is the culture at this age. (for most people). Hakuna Ma’vodka, it means no memories for the rest of your night. I mean you don’t know your national anthem but you can sing along to Vybz Kartel while doing the drops and the beats at the same time. You only start going to classes faithfully when you realize that your allowance of 70% attendance is growing thin. Being broke is normal when you want to eat.. But somehow Friday evening you will be popping bottles. Adakada-NO-bra!! Lol. Risky driving, excessive drinking, broke living and emotionally surviving is the order of the day. Everyday.<br>
After campus, the search for a job begins and your parents start looking at you funny when you take an extra slice of bread. They are just thinking.. ‘We should start charging you’ . Spreading CVs like Ebola . But If you are a recess kid, you are probably looking at you iPhone 6 wondering what language this is. Recess kids finish school and start working for dad or get connected to their uncle’s work place. God forbid I trek in my J’s. Road trips every weekend and bottle service in the club because, End month. The only struggle is dealing with KRA when you are importing your blue Subaru.<br>
What we all have on common, every one is more mature after campus, every one is trying to make money in one way or another and every one is trying to settle down in life.<br></p>

<p><strong>30 – 50 Years.</strong><br>
This is the age where almost every woman discovers Jesus and men discover campus girls. Walk into any club on a Saturday night and it looks like parents day, old men walking in holding young girls’ hands. While women start having kids and staying in to watch romance TV shows because they have none in real life. They are more into who will win Project fame than how their Children’s days went. Trading in twerking for twerksifu, one night stands for good night sleep and Jameson for just sons. Male idea of fun is football ,tusker baridi and nyama choma with the boys and the females have their chamas and church to socialize. Unless you are Kilimani mums, then you are probably at Zen gardens where you can barely see each other because, large hats and oversized sunglasses.<br>
Most people at this age are also in denial about their age so it’s not uncommon to see a woman carrying such a huge water bottle yet her baby is being carried by the maid. Or they sign up for an hour of Zumba class everyday yet they won’t give their husband 5 minutes of sex. The men have developed a beer belly, hair is in a recession, cheating on their wives with girls who have more crabs than the Indian Ocean and will not let their wives breathe. Dear men, of course your wife doesn’t look the way she used to, having a husband like you cannot be good for the skin. Life slows down and you start giving your kids complexes by all the yelling in the house. You might as well build a pole in her bedroom the minute she learns how to walk, or spike his breast milk with a little heroine. People in Kenya need to raise their kids in a better environment, tell them you love them often, correct them properly and don’t expose them to your fall outs as parents.<br></p>

<p><strong>50 – (When you drop.)</strong><br>
All the lifestyle diseases start to catch up with the recess kids..  High cholesterol, liver cirrhosis etc then the PE kids die of high blood pressure and heart attacks. If you are unlucky enough to live a long life..  You get a front row seat to the film where your body parts stop functioning one by one. Some others get into politics and eat tax payers money, fist fight in parliament and grow old in a pool of corruption money. All you need is the skill of holding more than one microphone in one hand . Kill your morality ,don’t think of all the starving children or they unemployed youth, it will just slow you down. Oooor you can pull a Hugh Hefner and get married to a 25 year old, which is what I will do. Lol. Lock up your children when I turn 50.</p>
        <p>
Despite all the problems we have in our country, I am honored and proud to be a Kenyan. (Most of The Time)  haha. </p>
